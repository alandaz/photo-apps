<!-- 
In order to make it easier to add alt text, there should be a button next to the like or share button on the post that is made for alt text. 
When the user clicks this button, a text box will pop up that prompts the user with a form to enter any alt text. 
The corresponding alt text will then be updated in the html file. 

Additionally, when a post is being made, there should also be an alt text button that allows the user to fill in alt text beforehand. 
That way, users donâ€™t have to wait until after they post to add alt text.
